"""Verification system for fact checking and hallucination reduction.

This module implements Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) + CRITIC to achieve
50-70% hallucination reduction through:

1. Streaming verification - Real-time verification when interns submit findings (<500ms)
2. Batch verification - Comprehensive verification during manager synthesis (~2s/finding)

Confidence Thresholds:
- >85%: Auto-accept (VERIFIED)
- 50-85%: Flag for review (FLAGGED)
- <50%: Reject, trigger additional search (REJECTED)
