## Research Methodology

### Sources Analyzed (February 2026)

**Reddit** (200+ posts, 1000+ comments):
- r/Entrepreneur (pain points with AI tools)
- r/perplexity_ai (user complaints, comparisons)
- r/OpenAI (ChatGPT Deep Research feedback)
- r/AskScienceDiscussion (academic AI tool usage)
- r/PhD (research workflow pain points)

**GitHub** (30+ issues):
- gpt-researcher (25K stars) - top feature requests
- Human-in-loop, GraphRAG, multimodal parsing
- Integration requests (Open-WebUI, Neo4j)

**YouTube** (10+ channels):
- Academic researcher reviews
- AI tool comparisons 2026
- Deep research tool rankings

**Web Searches**:
- Academic workflow pain points
- AI hallucination and trust issues
- Knowledge management integration (Obsidian, Zotero)
- Collaboration tools 2026
- Citation management AI tools

**Key Insight:** Trust and transparency are THE differentiators in 2026. Every major competitor (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini) faces the same criticism: "Sounds confident but often wrong, and I can't see WHY it made decisions."
