## Topic
Building Agentic AI for Offensive Penetration Testing

## Summary

ChatGPT Deep Research produced a report covering AI-powered penetration testing tools and frameworks.

### Frameworks Covered
- ARTEMIS (cost comparison: ~$18/hr AI vs $60/hr professionals)
- CAI (Cybersecurity AI) - open-source framework
- RedTeamLLM - offensive security operations
- PentestGPT - automated penetration testing
- xOffense - knowledge-enhanced LLMs for pentesting
- Nebula - reconnaissance and vulnerability analysis

### Key Findings
1. AI agents can perform systematic reconnaissance
2. Cost efficiency compared to human pentesters
3. Capability scope across multiple subnets
4. Tool execution with context window management

### Sources
~25 citations including:
- Academic papers from arXiv
- HackerOne benchmarking data
- GitHub repositories
- Technical documentation

## What's Missing (compared to claude-researcher)

1. **No 2026 sources** - Missing OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Apps 2026, NIST RFIs
2. **No vulnerability statistics** - Missing 94.4% prompt injection vulnerability rate
3. **No regulatory context** - Missing US Federal Register developments
4. **No knowledge graph** - Can't identify knowledge gaps
5. **No real-world case studies** - Missing IBM Bob exploitation (Jan 2026)
6. **Fewer frameworks** - Missing Hexstrike-AI, ÆSIR/FENRIR, CodeMender, PentAGI details
